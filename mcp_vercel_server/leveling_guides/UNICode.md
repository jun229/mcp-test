## **Uniswap Principles | Uni-code**

*Our Uniswap operating principles (Unicode) articulate who we are (our values) and how we work. They are our daily guideposts for how we interact with each other, our users, and our community.* 

**People First**

We believe easy, safe, fair value transfer on the internet can improve people’s lives. Access, security and experience is the center of everything we do. By pursuing decentralization, interoperability, and durability we align with our users over the long-term, and win. Internally, people are our greatest asset, and we strive for an environment where everyone can make an incredible impact. We share direct, kind feedback so we can improve. When we advocate for an idea, a technical tradeoff, or a business goal, we start with why — why it’s better for our user, our company.

**Simple**

Our craft is keeping it simple. In a complex field, we create clarity & simplicity. We write and build in human terms, understood by everyone. This shows up in the design and language of our user experience, across our code, and in how we speak to the world and each other. We are deliberate in the words and images we use.

**Pink**

We love pink, conceptually and irl. Disrupting the status quo is fun. We hold each other accountable to do serious work – without taking ourselves too seriously. We love unicorns, and we bring whimsy into our experiments and our day-to-day.  The people-first, internet-native financial system we’re building welcomes anyone.

**Push Through Ambiguity Together**

Startup life can be ambiguous — and especially at the frontier. We are at peace with the uncertainty. We push through resistance. We show up ready to explore new ideas. We have conviction that our mission is worth it. When things get hard, we stay on the same team. We create scalable solutions to make things less ambiguous in pursuit of our mission. We don’t assume shared knowledge or beliefs across our team or our users, and we seek to understand others’ “why.” When we don’t agree with something, we assume positive intent & default to trust.

**Build to Last, Iterate Fast**

We see through the clouds of today into what’s possible tomorrow. We don’t fall prey to short-term thinking or get distracted by narratives and prices. We aim to move fast, learn from our mistakes, and we ship when it’s right. Where our opinions bring safety, simplicity, and new choices in the best interest of our users, we express them. This long-term view is a big part of why we are a beloved brand. We must protect it.
