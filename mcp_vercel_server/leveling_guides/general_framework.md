Uniswap Labs Level Guide Framework

WHAT ARE LEVEL GUIDES?
Level Guides define a consistent set of skills that clarify the behaviors expected of employees at Uniswap. They define the HOW of performance and are used to enable consistent hiring, career development, internal mobility, and performance evaluation.

Level Guides are NOT:
- A job description
- A checklist for performance or promotion
- The sole input to performance or promotion evaluations

They are meant to act as a compass that guides us directionally, rather than function as a turn-by-turn GPS.

LEVEL STRUCTURE:
- Individual Contributors: UNI-1 through UNI-6
- Managers: UNI-M3 through UNI-M7, plus VP/SVP
- Specialized roles: Engineering (UNI 1-4) and Design (DESIGN 1-4)

CORE EVALUATION AREAS:
1. Ownership & Accountability
2. Teamwork / Collaboration  
3. Initiative
4. Skill & Strategy
5. Job Complexity
6. Supervision
7. Experience

HOW TO USE LEVEL GUIDES:
- Work with your manager to identify specific projects and timelines to grow within your level or to the next one
- To make sure that you're achieving objectives consistently at your level before moving to the next one
- Not a checklist: The guides are not a checklist but a set of paths, possibilities, skills, and appropriate opportunities that are expected at each level

EMBEDDED ACROSS TALENT LIFECYCLE:
- Hiring - scorecards & interview guides
- Expectation setting - manager reviews, ongoing feedback, performance concerns
- Development - career development plans, directionally for promotions
