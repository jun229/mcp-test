# UNI-2 Level Guide

**DESCRIPTION:** Independent problem solver, no longer leaning on managers to identify and solve problems.

**OWNERSHIP & ACCOUNTABILITY:** Works on individual tasks completely independently. Begins to bring issues forward that could have a negative impact on individual, team or organizational performance. Works out solutions with their manager on low-impact issues, not expected to solution the world's problems.

**TEAMWORK / COLLABORATION:** Builds relationships with peers across teams and functional verticals. Proactively seeks out feedback and demonstrates receptiveness & actioning on feedback.

**INITIATIVE:** Critical eye for process improvement; begins to suggest improvements and tweaks.

**SKILL & STRATEGY:** Developing professional expertise, applies company policies and procedures to resolve a variety of limited complexity issues. Beginning to talk the talk of UL & technical strategy, but not responsible to implement or execute on them.

**JOB COMPLEXITY:** Operates at the team level. Planning horizon and accountability 1 quarter or less.

**SUPERVISION:** Normally receives general instructions on routine work, detailed instructions on new projects or assignments.

**EXPERIENCE:** Typically a Bachelor’s degree and a minimum of 2 years of related experience; or a Master’s or PhD without experience; or equivalent work experience.

### Engineering Specific (if applicable)

**Software Implementation:** I write high quality, readable, well-tested code. Code modules I write exhibit good separation of concerns. I maintain the quality of my team’s codebases and prevent incidents by providing thoughtful and thorough PR reviews.

**Domain Expertise:** I’m skilled in the language and frameworks my team uses through building features, fixing bugs, and soliciting feedback from experts on my team. I’m able to navigate the codebases of my team, understand the context, and implement a solution given a clear set of requirements and use cases.

**System Design:** Given a set of requirements, I am able to brainstorm multiple ways of implementing a component and existing codebase constraints. I clearly outline the different implementation strategies in design docs I share with my team in order to get feedback. When designing a system, I’m able to highlight external dependencies and the risks posed by using them. I consider the durability and extensibility of the systems I design. I’m able to break a well-scoped feature down into its software components. I’m able to define how these components interact with each other and design clean APIs between them.

**Ownership & Project Delivery:** I am able to own the end-to-end delivery of a well-scoped work stream, including collaborating across engineering and cross-functional stakeholders.

**Engineering Craft:** I invest in system reliability and am a valuable member of the team’s on-call rotation.

### Design Specific (if applicable)

**Product:** Takes an idea from 50 to 100. Translates existing problem statements into design solutions with assistance from the team. Leverages existing data and user insights to inform decisions. Has proficient knowledge of our product and crypto space. Relies on established design patterns and best practices.

**Craft:** Draws a wide range of design solutions. Validates some solutions with simple prototypes. Uses some low fidelity wireframes in initial process. Uses basic design tools fluently. Is familiar with advanced tools and other mediums (e.g. motion, code). Broadly communicates basic design specifications. Identifies areas where implementation doesn’t match design spec. Fluently applies design elements & principles.

**Systems:** Fluently incorporates established design system or brand language into solutions. Demonstrates awareness of how brand and product are tied together.

**Collaboration & Leadership:** Translates high level feedback into tangible outcomes to incorporate. Provides mostly tactical feedback to peers. Communicates design process and decision making. Shares problem space & context. Actively participates in team processes.
