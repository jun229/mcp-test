**DESCRIPTION:** Takes initiative in identifying and resolving issues. Leads the design and execution of small to medium projects.

**OWNERSHIP & ACCOUNTABILITY:** Fully owns projects in their area. Take responsibility for decisions and consequences of those decisions. Translate problem statements into solutions. My expertise in my field and space allows me to be critical of problem statements and consider alternatives. Supports development of immediate team through participating in interviewing.

**TEAMWORK / COLLABORATION:** Leads collaborative efforts to support strong team results and effective working relationships. Models UNI-code and facilitates team interactions effectively. Work with cross functional partners and my manager on goal setting & planning, ensuring that constraints and dependencies are accounted for. Advocate & suggest ways to update our current state (eg tech debt, stale processes) and propose future solutions to regularly occurring problems.

**INITIATIVE:** Takes initiative through identifying gaps and opportunities, and solutions.

**SKILL & STRATEGY:** A seasoned, experienced professional with a full understanding of area of specialization; resolves a wide range of limited-complexity issues in creative ways, and allows them to be critical of problem statements and consider alternatives.

**JOB COMPLEXITY:** Operates at the team level, starting to work cross-team. Planning horizon and accountability of a 1-2 quarters.

**SUPERVISION:** Normally receives no instruction on day-to-day work, general instructions on new assignments, as needed. Work is reviewed at critical milestones.

### Engineering Specific (if applicable)

**Core Skill:** Project leader

**Software Implementation:** I am a mentor for the languages and frameworks my team uses and consistently demonstrate my expertise through the code I author and through my code reviews. I set the bar on high quality PR reviews.

**Domain Expertise:** I promote best coding practices defined by my team for the languages and frameworks my team uses. In the absence of best practices, I create them as well as documentation & systems that allow engineers to follow them easily.

**System Design:** Given a goal, I am able to work out the requirements, timelines, and brainstorm multiple ways of implementing a solution. I clearly outline the different implementation strategies in design docs.

**Ownership & Project Delivery:** I am able to own the end-to-end delivery of a large, ambiguous project. This includes breaking down the project into work streams that can be delegated amongst engineers and sequenced effectively.

**Engineering Craft:** I am able to own and roll out major features reliably, including cross-team concerns. I define clear eng success metrics for my system and implement ways to track them through launch.
